                        <p>
                            The first time I ever made money was from selling CD's to my classmates in school which had the files to download a popular game called GTA Vice City, Now that I look back at this event, I realize that subconsciously I've always known my calling: 1) I was good at technology and 2) I had an entrepreneurial spirit which would take me places in life!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Down the years, I've taken every opportunity that's come my way to exhibit my Leadership skills, Be it the Professional Sport that I played for 15 years or the numerous Group projects that I've been part of. So, During my Bachelors, when I started working for a Cloud Computing Startup as an Intern at the age of 19, I knew I had a great opportunity in front of me and I wanted to make the most of it. So, I put my dancing shoes and my thinking hat on and I was away!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would like to breakdown my journey from an Intern to Director into three parts.

                               T Harv Eker once said "The Only Time You Are Actually Growing is When Youâ€™re Uncomfortable", the beginning of a professional journey brings uncertainty and eagerness.
